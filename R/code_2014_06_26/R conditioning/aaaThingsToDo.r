Things to do in Seattle meeting 24-27 July 2014
1. Do the likelihood profiles by steepness (default)  DONE
2. Do the Indonesian selectivity ones to check
3. Find the code for the likelihood profiles by natural mortality

A. take one cell, fit that cell to two models, one with no upq, the other
estimates upq. 
Each predicts LL1 CPUE at year and length
Get the bubble plots.

B. upq for three years 2008-2010 then reverse it to go back again. 
Likelihood profile for this will be done by Ana.
